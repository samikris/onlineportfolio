          <h3>Can Changes in Eye Appearance Be Used to Predict High Blood Pressure?</h3>
          <h4> <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nVCwmL8KUQF20wo7nRzw_cL7pBPDh9FH/view?usp=sharing"> Abstract </a></h4> 
            <p>     In January of 2023, I came up with a simple project idea to use what I had learned in my online courses. I entered my project in ACSEF (Alameda Country Science and Engineering Fair). My project was aimed at answering the motivating question: "Can Eye Appearance Be Used to Predict High Blood Pressure?". I combined some of the foundational deep learning knowledge I had picked up, as well as online resources, to answer this question. </p>
            <p>I brought a prototype of my project to the fair, created in Google Colab. It was functional, but did not have accuracy or very promising results because it had been developed in such a short amount of time. I also collected a limited amount of data, but my model definitely showed visual classification in action.</p>
                              <iframe src="assets/quad.pdf" height="30%" width="115%" scrolling="auto"></iframe>
            <p>Although I didn't do perform well in the fair, I spoke to a lot of judges who gave me fantastic feedback about my prototype and offered to help me develop my idea further. </p>

          <h3>Over the Summer...</h3>
          <p>I’m very passionate about the environment and the use of AI to help understand and address challenges
            facing the natural world. This year, as part of my volunteer internship at a local wildlife center, I have
            been doing a project to understand the spread of wildfires in California using data science.
            My weekly shifts involve handling and interpreting for reptiles, mammals and invertebrates through
            presentations, for which I needed to closely observe the habits of animals, collect data about their
            behavior, and also understand how changes in the local environment affect this behavior. </p>

<p>This in turn led me
            to learn how geospatial data science can be used to understand both short and long-term changes in our
            environment, like how the spread and intensity of seasonal wildfires is related to tree death and in turn to
            longer-term drought. I have been learning how to use publicly available data from Calfire along with pandas,
            scikit-learn and streamlit to analyze wildfires and their effects on local ecosystems. I’ve recently begun
            learning how to use machine learning and deep learning to diagnose tree health from online satellite
            imagery. I am currently doing a Coursera specialization on ML with Python and Tensorflow, and I plan to
            complete a Deep Learning specialization to develop my skills further.
