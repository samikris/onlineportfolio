            <p>Hi! I’m Samiksha, a junior in DEDA. My goal this year is to learn more about engineering and its applications, especially in areas I am interested in such as aerospace and nuclear engineering. As computer science becomes increasingly important, I also hope to develop a set of skills that allows me to combine coding and physical aspects of engineering together. I think it is important not only to solve problems with my engineering knowledge, but also communicate it to others.
So far, I have spent my time in DEDA finding what I am passionate about by experimenting with different areas of engineering. After a few field trips last year, I have also become interested in using engineering or computer science in research to tackle climate change and other environmental issues. This year, I have been exploring electrical engineering because I am in Digital Electronics, an engineering specialization course that focuses on building and understanding digital circuits. 
<p>
              <p>Developing problem solving skills, verbal communication, and analytical thinking skills has become increasingly important to me. I have accumulated skills like knowledge about modern technology and coding and being observant of my surroundings. With this, I have been able to process challenging concepts with ease and apply them to aspects of my environment. In high school, I have the ability to learn and communicate concepts despite their challenges because I am willing to overcome difficulty and make mistakes. I am a youth volunteer for Lindsay Wildlife Experience and the AAUW (American Association of University Women), where I share my scientific knowledge with the public and learn about various environmental issues. To challenge myself, I joined Gael Force Robotics and I have been a member of the competition team 5327S since 2020, where I attend competitions and assist my team captain in designing a robotic system that performs various functions in a game. On my own time, I have also been working on a Deep Learning and Machine Learning Specialization to learn how to work with data, especially related to the environment and wildfires. 

              <p>
              <p>These activities have taught me how to communicate my observations to others and design a complex system with a team. I would love to apply my knowledge to environmental problems closer to home, like figuring out how to protect local ecosystems and studying extreme climates and wildfires. I hope that my curiosity, hard work, and experiences in DEDA will allow me to find what I’m interested in this year.
