              <h4>Lindsay Wildlife Experience - Outstanding Wildlife Leader (OWL)
              </h4>
              <img src="assets/img/lindsay.png" alt="profile photo" style="width:300px;" ALIGN="right" HSPACE=15px; />
              <p>I have been an OWL, or Outstanding Wildlife Leader, since 2020. As an OWL, I have helped with public
                education, animal husbandry, and data collection for a variety of native wildlife from California.
                I volunteer at Lindsay wildlife every week and I help lead events for the public with a team of other
                youth volunteers. I also help design curriculum that can be used to educate students about environmental
                issues. I've also been looking at the intersection between technology and biology, specifically using
                data applications to track populations of animals. Being an OWL has taught me leadership skills, as well
                as the importance of our environment. The knowledge I have acquired has also motivated me to design
                solutions in engineering that can help with local wildlife and environmental issues.
              </p>
              <h4>AAUW (Livermore-Pleasanton-Dublin) Volunteer</h4>
              <img src="assets/img/AAUW.png" style="width:250px;" ALIGN="left" HSPACE=15px; />
              <p>After being nominated for the Tech Trek Camp scholarship in 2019 for girls interested in STEM, I have
                been volunteering at STEM events for young girls that are organized by the AAUW. I help teach younger
                girls about the importance of science and develop their interest in different fields. This volunteering
                opportunity has taught me to me how to communicate my experiences and knowledge to a younger audience
                and uplift others.

                <h2>Guest Speakers</h2>
              </center>
              <h4>Donald James (NASA)</h4>
              <img src="assets/img/donald.png" style="width:200px;" ALIGN="left" HSPACE=15px; />
              <p> On December 8, 2021, I had the incredible opportunity to hear Donald James talk about his 35 year
                experience at NASA and his advice for high schoolers to be successful. Donald James worked in education
                and public affairs, and before he retired, he was an Assistant Administrator for Education. He spent
                most of his time at the NASA Ames Research Site as an educator. James talked about the incredible
                history of NASA and its projects, such as the Orion Spacecraft, Mars Missions, and James Webb telescope.
                In his early days, he was apprehensive about working at NASA because he had other passions, but after a
                life-changing educational event and discussion with his father, he realized the importance and prestige
                of his occupation. In 1996, when the Challenger Spacecraft exploded, NASA decided to educate the public
                about what had happened. Working with diverse audiences across the country gave James a new vision of
                education.
              <p>
              <p> As his career progressed, he moved up in position and his boss was a high level marine general. At
                this point in his life, James realized that it was not solely his intelligence that had allowed him to
                prosper, but his focus on manners and kindness that his mother had taught him. He went on to write a
                book, Manners Will Take You Where Brains and Money Won't. James emphasized the importance of finding
                support, whether it's family or strangers, because you need honesty when you are struggling. </p>
              </p>From this guest speaker event, I learned that success comes down to improvement and communication
              paired with intelligence and hard work. You don't have to be a prodigy as a child, but throughout your
              life, you should make an effort to grow, both intellectually and morally. Donald James inspired me to take
              initiative as well because I have to show interviewers and employers that I am truly interested in
              engineering. Moreover, people are more likely to value your work when you are respectful and willing to
              make mistakes and hear criticism. </p>
              <h4>Kimberli Zhong (MIT)</h4>
              <img src="assets/img/kimberli.png" alt="profile photo" style="width:200px;" ALIGN="left" HSPACE=15px; />
              <p>My second influential guest speaker was Kimberli Zhong, an DEDA and MIT alumni who now works at an
                autonomous vehicle company. Zhong started off with her high school experience and how she was already an
                excelling student who was on top of things since her freshman year. SHe was a member of the first
                graduating class of DEDA and started the Gael Force Robotics Club, and this was interesting to me
                because I am a part of both of these groups. She graduated from DHS in 2014 to study computer science at
                MIT, which is incredible, and she currently works in a startup today. She was always good at math and
                science, although she was only exposed to engineering in high school, and she cultivated her passion for
                STEM through robotics. Zhong made it clear that a critical aspect was the secondary outlets for energy
                and club culture because it allowed her to work her way up to world championship tiers of robotics. In
                high school, her primary exposure to programming was through clubs and engineering classes, and her
                personal experiences with coding with robots and raspberry pi.
              <p>

              </p>Although DHS is different now, Zhong’s description of her high school years was inspiring because it
              revealed how much initiative she took and how anyone could get better at something by getting involved
              with the groups in their community. The theme of club culture was relevant throughout Zhong’s life because
              when she went to MIT for STEM, her main connections were found through clubs, like HACKMIT. She discussed
              how rigorous and CS-heavy her courses were, as well as competitive, and how she was able to get through
              them because of her passion. She then began to pursue more research positions in grad school by reaching
              out to a lab and becoming a full time TA. Zhong’s presentation was memorable because throughout her life,
              she learned to set personal deadlines and constantly push herself. </p>
              </p>Zhong made it clear that the most impactful part of college was having fun and making sacrifices for
              fun. College is about exploring and having the freedom to try things out, so it was essentially a stepping
              stone in her life. She quickly learned that she disliked research and began to look at startups. In her
              post-college life, she works at a startup called Applied Intuition that is now a billion dollar company
              that develops safer autonomous vehicles. Because she works closely with robots, Zhong feels that her
              experiences at DHS really did prepare her for her STEM career. Her presentation was useful because she
              also described her experiences as a woman in STEM and how it was always a challenge, but she found subtle
              ways to assert herself. </p>

            <h2>Field Trips</h2>
          </center>
          <h4>Roche Field Trip (Virtual)</h4>
          <img src="assets/img/roche.png" alt="profile photo" style="width:250px;" ALIGN="left" HSPACE=10px; />
          <p>During the Roche Virtual Field Trip, I got to meet a number of industry professionals who talked about
            their backgrounds and the importance of their work at Roche. Roche is a biotech company from Santa Clara
            that specializes in pharmaceuticals and diagnostics. Their diagnostics include molecular testing, clinical
            chemistry, patient salve testing, next generation sequencing, and lab IT. I participated in a coding
            workshop that taught me about AI, led by Franklin Ventura, a biomedical and software engineer in research
            and early development. To simulate something similar to what he does, we used an online simulator to create
            a piece of AI that used visual recognition to identify certain poses we made. It was similar to how
            researchers use python in research groups for digital pathology solutions to look at tissue and visualize
            patient samples. Although this was a simple demo, it was very informative because it truly demonstrated how
            far pathology has come and the significant applications of technology in medicine, like detecting cancer.
            There are an increasing number of cancer patients, which generates petabytes of data yearly, and there is a
            need to handle the data when there are fewer pathologists. The process requires automation when looking at
            biopsies to increase accuracy.
          <p>
          <p>Then, as a group, we met a diverse group of staff at Roche, some who worked more with more technology and
            others biology. One of the researchers who stood out to me was Alissa, who was a new employee working at
            Roche. She had just graduated college in 2020 and she helped with verifying and validating the new Ultra
            Plus product by running numerous tests. I was amazed how she went from having a restaurant job to working at
            Roche because she was passionate about cancer diagnostics and able to combine her abilities in technology to
            her interests. She talked about her career path and how she focused on molecular biology while ensuring that
            she was familiar with computer science as well because as biology progresses, there will be more technology
            required. This aspect of the field trip was memorable because it was very inspiring to hear a younger
            employee’s career experience. She talked about her fears as a young person as well as her interests, and
            personally, it motivated me to cultivate my passions more.</p>

          <h3>Livermore Labs Tour (Virtual)</h3>
          <img src="assets/img/LLL.png" alt="profile photo" style="width:250px;" ALIGN="right" HSPACE=15px; />
          <p>In my POE class, I participated in the Lawerence Livermore Lab virtual field trip. LLL was established in
            1952 and it is 1 of the 17 Department of Energy Laboratories. They focus on experimental testing and “big”
            science in teams for the interest of the nation, so they have employees who work in many fields of STEM. One
            of their key facilities is the National Ignition Facility, and it uses supercompiters to learn about high
            energy situations, like stars and nuclear fusion. Arsenia Rendon, a software developer who controls laser
            configurations, gave a virtual tour to show our class what a laser looks like in certain situations. The NIF
            is a massive facility with the highest energy lasers in the world and a computer system that operates a 192
            laser system. Scientists in NIF try to understand nuclear fusion and recreate processes that start to
            produce energy. Their primary objectives, according to Rendon, are to maintain a nuclear stock-pile, explore
            nuclear fusion and cleaner energy, and understand what our universe is made of.</p>
          <p>Rendon went in depth about
            the processes, describing how they take lasers and converge them into capsules to target a small, carefully
            engineered target. She made it clear that most of the time, they are collecting data and formulating the
            best scenarios with computers as opposed to testing because it is a complex process. Lasers are used to find
            a target, for diagnostic materials, and optics. We were shown around the area with lasers and where the
            supercomputers are in NIF, which was very inspiring because it is such a complex facility. Rendon talked
            about how she majored in business and felt very inexperienced upon arriving at NIF, but she soon began to
            specialize in software development and she is a key employee in her department. She works specifically with
            the high-performance machines that are used for calculations and processing data from test trials, like the
            Dante diagnostic. She also went in depth about KDP crystals that use laser glass to amp up energy and create
            streamlined beams that are filtered to produce energy, as well as diagnostic aid. Overall, learning about
            this massive, complex facility close to home was memorable and inspiring because LLL uses people from all
            fields to do their work. I’ve always wanted to learn about what local lab facilities do to improve the
            nation and combat our energy problem, and this was quitee eye-opening. Rendon’s story was also motivational
            because it does not truly matter what you study because if you are able to apply it and have an openness to
            learn about new areas, you can work in a setting as complex as the NIF. </p>
